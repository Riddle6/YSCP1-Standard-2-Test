-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made while creating the Tip Calculator code or Pseudo-code:

1. Created separate functions instead of a single main() due to the LOOP forever interfering with the EXCEPTION or
   the 2nd LOOP code would be unreachable.

2. Merged display_summary() and calculate_bills() into a single function; get_summary() due to too many parameters.
   There were more parameters than there were with the amount of functions that could be called.

3. Changed the Total_Bill to a constant variable.
